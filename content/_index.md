I'm glad you asked. 

My wife and I love to hike. We are also not what you'd consider to be particularly fit. 

In the course of looking at reviews on sites like AllTrails, we found a number of discrepancies like:

* **Easy**: Very often not easy. 
* **Some rock scrambling**: A large amount of rock scrambling. Boulders abound. 
* **I did this hike in one hour**: This hike will take us half of a day. 
* **I run this trail**: Do not read this review if you're fat. 
* **Nice little trail**: This trail may be the end of the road for you. Affectionately referred to as *NLT*.

## So what's the point? 

I think AllTrails should be a tool for people to determine whether they can handle a hike. This especially true, I think, for novice hikers, people who are a bit more out of shape, or bigger folks like me.

It often isn't. 

So this blog attempts to correct that.

## How?

Each post is an unabashed, honest review of a trail. 

These reviews abide by a few rules:

1. **We rate on a five point scale:** AllTrails breaks trail difficulty into three, which often leaves us feeling stumped when a trail marked as "Easy" is tough, or a "Moderate" trail includes severe elevation gain. A five point scale with midpoints at "Easy-Moderate" and "Moderate-Hard" helps address this.
2. **We provide full description of trails:** Reviews often fall short of truly describing a trail. We're fixing that! 
3. **We evaluate trails using a difficulty-payoff ratio:** We're not saying every trail should be easy. However, the criteria we rate trails on often has a lot to do with what the ratio is between how hard the trail is (effort) and how great the trail is (payoff). 
4. **We cater to plus-size hikers, but we don't discriminate:** Anyone can read our reviews. This space truly exists because we see a gap in outdoors media that often doesn't include larger folks. This is a space that specifically caters to those folks. 
   
    However, this advice can apply to anyone who is a novice hiker or is unsure of their abilities. All are welcome!
